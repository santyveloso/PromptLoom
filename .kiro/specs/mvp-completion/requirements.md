# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the PromptLoom MVP by implementing the remaining core functionality for saved prompt management, UI polish, and deployment. The goal is to deliver a fully functional block-based visual prompt engineering tool that allows users to create, save, load, and manage their GPT prompts with a polished, dopamine-rich user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage my saved prompts so that I can easily access and reuse my previous work

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of all saved prompts for the current authenticated user
2. WHEN a user clicks on a saved prompt THEN the system SHALL load that prompt's blocks into the builder interface
3. WHEN a user deletes a saved prompt THEN the system SHALL remove it from Firestore and update the UI immediately
4. WHEN there are no saved prompts THEN the system SHALL display an engaging empty state with helpful guidance
5. IF a prompt fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the current builder state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations and visual feedback so that the interface feels responsive and delightful to use

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blocks are added, removed, or reordered THEN the system SHALL animate these changes with smooth transitions
2. WHEN the preview pane updates THEN the system SHALL animate the content change with a subtle transition
3. WHEN saved prompts are loaded or deleted THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through animations
4. WHEN the user interacts with buttons or interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide hover and click animations
5. WHEN loading states occur THEN the system SHALL display animated loading indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear guidance when sections are empty so that I understand how to use the application effectively

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the prompt builder has no blocks THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with clear instructions on how to add blocks
2. WHEN the saved prompts list is empty THEN the system SHALL display an encouraging empty state explaining the save functionality
3. WHEN the preview pane is empty THEN the system SHALL show placeholder text explaining what will appear there
4. WHEN empty states are displayed THEN they SHALL include relevant call-to-action buttons or links
5. IF the user has just completed an action THEN empty states SHALL acknowledge the context appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably in production so that I can use it anywhere without issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to production THEN all Firebase authentication SHALL work correctly with proper environment variables
2. WHEN users access the production site THEN all Firestore operations SHALL function properly with appropriate security rules
3. WHEN the application loads in production THEN all assets SHALL be properly optimized and cached
4. WHEN users interact with the production app THEN performance SHALL be comparable to local development
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual design and typography so that the application feels professional and cohesive

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any part of the application THEN the system SHALL use consistent fonts, colors, and spacing throughout
2. WHEN elements are in different states (hover, active, disabled) THEN they SHALL have appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN the application is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL remain functional and visually appealing
4. WHEN text content is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate hierarchy and readability standards
5. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN they SHALL have clear affordances indicating their functionality
